# Stoic meditation

hedonic threadmill:
  * problem living life of "wanting stuff" is that once you get what you
    wanted you want a new thing
  * if you want a car once you buy it you want a better car
  * if you become a bilionair you may want to abondon your long loving
    wife for hot model

Stoic try to find a cure for "hedonic threadmill" in **learning how to
want what you already have** by using these techniques

where will-power fails is in a fact that one parth of mind gives you reason to forget about desire, the other part of brain will trigger desire in the first place


### negative visualization

* think of what if you loose something important
* it always can get worse
* if you live in a hut you may end up in Tent, if you live in a tent you
  may have to sleep on a street
* if you are going for a operation be glad that your doctor didn't tell
  you "your condition is in-operable


### last time visualization

or "last time" thinking

Imagine you are doing the thing you do last time. Last time you give a
kiss. Last time you eat chocolate. This way you make simple things more
enjoable


Super easy to take simple/small things for granted and not realize that
this may be last time you do them, but when was the last time you played
hide and seek. When was the last time you used rotary phone ?


#### why it's difficult to live in a moment

There is evolutionary benefit why we are always thinking about
past/future. Back in the days when we were hunters constantly thinking
about past / future increased our chances of not get killed or help us get
something to eat (wasn't a gazzel near that river last time I was hungry?)

Problem is that now days that same mechanism of overanalying past/future
is quite counter productive and make our life a missery (...why did I said
that; ...I should have done this, ... I will be happy once I xyz)


> And that's why it's super hard to get focused in midful meditation

So there was no real benefitt on siting down in savana and enjoing the
view as it was wast of time to gather food or oportunity to get killed.


Last time vizualization provides a trick to better live in the moment
