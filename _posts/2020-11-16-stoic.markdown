# Stoic meditation

hedonic threadmill:
  * problem living life of "wanting stuff" is that once you get what you
    wanted you want a new thing
  * if you want a car once you buy it you want a better car
  * if you become a bilionair you may want to abondon your long loving
    wife for hot model

Stoic try to find a cure for "hedonic threadmill" in **learning how to
want what you already have** by using these techniques

where will-power fails is in a fact that one parth of mind gives you reason to forget about desire, the other part of brain will trigger desire in the first place


### negative visualization

* think of what if you loose something important
* it always can get worse
* if you live in a hut you may end up in Tent, if you live in a tent you
  may have to sleep on a street
* if you are going for a operation be glad that your doctor didn't tell
  you "your condition is in-operable
